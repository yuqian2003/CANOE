# Beyond Regularity: Modeling Chaotic Mobility Patterns for Next Location Prediction üß†

CANOE is a novel model designed to predict a user's next destination by effectively balancing their periodic and chaotic movement patterns, while also leveraging contextual information for improved accuracy.


## Introduction üåü

The analysis of human mobility is a pivotal task with broad applications, from optimizing urban resources to providing personalized navigation. A significant challenge in this field is accurately predicting a user's next location, a task complicated by the dual nature of human movement: it is both periodic (e.g., daily commutes) and chaotic (e.g., spontaneous trips). 

To address these limitations, Our project introduces an novel model that integrates a biologically inspired chaotic attention mechanism to better balance chaotic and periodic mobile pattern.

## Key Modules ‚ú®

- üåê Multimodal Contextual Embedding Module: Aiming at transforming heterogeneous ``who-when-where'' contexts into unified vector representations
- üìù Tri-Pair Interaction Encoder: To capture pairwise relationships among user, time, and location modalities
- üîÑ Cross Context Attentive Decoder: Integrating the features of pairwise interaction by aligning ``who-when-where'' dependencies
