**MAS4POI** is an innovative multi-agent system (MAS) designed to enhance next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation through the collaboration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents. Each agent in the system is specialized to handle different aspects of the recommendation process, leveraging the power of LLMs to generate accurate and contextually relevant recommendations. The system has been evaluated on two real-world datasets and integrates six different LLMs to showcase its effectiveness.
